Abstract Data Types and Data Structures in C

Labs taken during Winter 2018

Lab 1 (Count Words): Count the number of words in a text file.

Lab 2 (Set ADT): Implement a Set Abstract Data Type (ADT) with sorted and unsorted arrays.

Lab 3 (Hash ADT): Implement Set ADT with a Hash Table with Linear Probing.

Lab 4 (Linked Hash Table): Implement Set ADT with Hashing by Chaining.

Lab 5 (Huffman Queue): Implement Priority Queue ADT with array representation of Heap and use heap ideas for Huffman coding.

Lab 6 (Quicksort): Implement Set ADT with Hash Table with Linear Probing; returns sorted list (difference from Lab 4); uses Quicksort algorithm.

Final Project: Find the most time efficient implementation for different applications/scenarios.
